# LeetCode Problem Solutions

This repository serves as a collection of solutions of some of the problems i solved on LeetCode, showcasing my journey and solutions to challenges encountered on the platform. These are some of the most known problems on the platform, most of them have medium difficulty.

## Overview

LeetCode is an online platform offering a diverse set of coding problems, spanning algorithms and data structures. This repository contains my solutions implemented in Python, organized to provide insights into different problem-solving approaches and also to me to have a sort of history of the problems i solved and how my solutions can change over time while i become a better developer.

## Structure

- **Problem Categories**: Solutions are categorized based on problem macro tag (ARRAY, TREES, DP etc), facilitating easy navigation and exploration.
- **Approach Explanation**: For some problems there are some comments and explanation to better understand the solution. I will try to add more while i will upload new solutions.
- **Time and space complexity**: Description of time and space complexity on average. Most of these solutions can be improved.
- **Python Implementation**: All solutions are coded in Python. For some problems there are also solutions coded in Java. While I am learning golang I will add also problems in this language.
There are also some problems in SQL (MS SQL SERVER and PostgreSQL taken from the 50 sql server questions, only medium and hard problems).

## Usage

- **Exploration**: Navigate through problem categories to explore solutions and learn diverse problem-solving strategies.
- **Learning**: Utilize these solutions to understand various algorithms and techniques applied to solve LeetCode problems.
